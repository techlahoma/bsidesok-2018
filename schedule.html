A skilled attacker is probably not going to throw a sheer volume of different attacks at your app to see what sticks. Much like a skilled coder learns to recognize "code smells" - certain symptoms that suggest a problem; a skilled attacker recognizes specific things that may indicate a vulnerability. A simple example would be a querystring argument containing a url. It may be an open HTTP redirect, an API call that can be hijacked, a cross-site scripting flaw, or perhaps nothing at all. One of the best tools developers and application owner can use to secure their own apps is the ability to spot potential vulnerabilities the same way an attacker would.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Mic Whitehorn-Gillam
I started coding in the late 80s with MS-DOS batch files and later BASIC. a few years later I moved into Windows GUI apps, and then started into websites around 1997. It was several years later that I actually became primarily a web app developer, where I had full-stack responsibilities for the vast majority of a decade across several different stacks. Security was always an area of interest for me. I learned as much as I could, applied it as a developer, and in the last year it became my primary responsibility as a penetration tester. I don't know everything about web apps, but I've picked up a lot over the years and I'm always grateful for the opportunity to share that knowledge.</p></div></div></div><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="speakers/example/headshot.png" alt="Example Speaker"/><h5>Track 3</h5><h3>The Beginner's Guide to ICS: How to Never Sleep Soundly Again</h3><h4>Dan Bougere</h4></div><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"><li class="nav-room1 active"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#speaker-talk">Talk</a></li><li class="nav-room1"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#speaker-bio">Bio</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div id="speaker-talk" class="tab-pane active"><p>The Beginner's Guide to ICS: How to Never Sleep Soundly Again

n the fast paced world of information security, analysts are tasked to perform seemingly and often improbable feats of data analysis, and produce actionable results. Actionable could mean, things to block, collect, or be-on-the-look-out (BOLO). Data sources can range from data obtained on-line, device log files, PCAPs, and miscellaneous CSV files to name a few. Seldom does the data align properly, and it could be missing vital contextual information. On the surface, the various data sets may not appear to have any relationship. Not to mention, the small problem, the information totals are in the millions. As if your day was not already turbulent. When, where, why and how do we begin to make sense of the madness? The answer lies in in the solution to this question: How do we eat an elephant? One byte at a time.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Ramece Cave

In this talk, we’ll cover how to create a script that will cause Denial of Service throughout the network by creating IP address conflicts. After demonstrating the effects, we’ll discuss how to prevent this from happening in your network. Internal networking weaknesses are well known, and strategies to mitigate the problems have been around for a long time.  What is new today is the ease with which attackers can cause massive chaos inside your network, and how many IoT devices are probably running free throughout your environment. Fortunately for the Blue Team, the Python language, and specifically the Scapy library, make it incredibly easy to craft and send fake packets, so mocking up attacks in the lab is easier than ever. Covered topics include how ARP works, an quick intro to Python and SCAPY, a script to cause chaos, and some tips on configuring your network to fight back.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Bobby Simpson

Canary tokens can be thought of as web bugs for documents, executables, or even database records and source code repositories -- canaries that fire when a victim or attacker interacts with a tokened resource. This talk discusses techniques to use canaries for offense and defense, detecting interactions with your token when they occur on any system that isn't fully isolated from the internet.<br/>For defense, these grant visibility into successful attacks in a manner similar to honeypots, but focus on the information attempting to be obtained rather than a network asset. They are particularly interesting for the feedback provided in cloned site phishing attacks and other areas that are usually "dark" to defenders.<br/>But tokens are also highly useful for attackers. They've become indispensable in our attacks against live networks, granting valuable debug information on failed exploits, failed and successful phishing attempts, the specific types of network defenses getting in the way, and similar useful information.<br/>This talk will cover typical setups, modifications to the open source repos and configs you'll want to make, and fun examples of all of the above.<br/>I mean, what attacker wouldn't open the file 'Netsec_passwords_all_Q1_2017.xlsx'?</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Nathan Keltner

With media attention and the advent of IIoT, awareness of control system vulnerabilities is arguably at an all-time high. What you may not be aware of, however, are the lesser known technologies and attack opportunities lurking in many industrial control environments. While you’ve probably heard about fragile IP stacks in embedded devices, unpatched Windows, and rampant MS08-067 in ICS, the story doesn’t end there. In this presentation, we'll examine overlooked and often undiscovered attack surface based on a decade of ICS assessment and testing experience in the oil and gas, electric power, and manufacturing industries. </p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Jason Holcomb

Just as the title says, we go over the humble origins, touch on the notable variants of yesteryear, the big hitters today, and discuss the future of ransomware. It's no longer just for windows anymore. Linux, Mac, and mobile platforms are all ripe for extortion. <br/>This humorous and entertaining talk teachest everyone, from Mom and Pops to large enterprise organizations, what's really happening and how to protect themselves. </p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Andy Thompson

Cryptography provides protection of data that is inside one trusted unit which can be delivered to another trusted unit via a channel controlled by an active attacker. When done properly, this allows communication of data which can be trusted by both sides and has no value to an attacker. When done poorly, this is nothing more than the illusion of security and history has its share of bad implementations of cryptography. These were accidental issues, or mistakes made by creating home-grown algorithms by someone who knew just a little about cryptographic theory. <br/>While the Blue Team is struggling to stay on top of the never-ending chaos of log messages from every script-kiddie around the world, there is a continuing struggle to determine whether the trusted communication channels can actually be trusted. Additionally, there’s always the nightmare scenario of the code simply walking out the door. What secrets would be exposed in that case and is cryptography really helping?<br/>In this talk we show why home-grown cryptography should not be trusted and even third-party code should be examined with a skeptical eye. Practical tips are given for doing audits related to cryptography and how to have an early warning on breaches.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Frank Gifford

How Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are Changing the Security Game
We’ve all been using machine learning and artificial intelligence for some time now with such things as facial recognition in Facebook to voice recognition on our smart phones. What many are not aware of is that there are significant innovations occurring in the security space that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide the next evolution of tried and true security tools like anti malware, network forensics, and user identity.<br/>This presentation will start with an overview of machine learning and how it works at a high level. We will then take a brief look at one use case – antimalware, that is currently displacing traditional antimalware solutions at an increasing pace. We will then discuss some up and coming use cases that are being still developed, and provide some examples of existing tools in these spaces.</p></div><div id="speaker-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Chris Yates
